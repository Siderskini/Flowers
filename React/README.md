This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) but then was rebuilt with `npx create-rsbuild --template react` to get the most out of rsbuild (Rust based, very fast and modern).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
